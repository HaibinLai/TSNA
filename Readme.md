# TSNA: A Telnet like Service with simplified NTLM Authentication
## Author: Haibin Lai, Student ID: 12211612

Telnet is a network protocol primarily used to establish text-based, bidirectional communication
 between a local computer and a remote server. It operates over a TCP/IP connection, allowing users
 to remotely control servers via command-line interface. Telnet is often used to manage devices,
 servers, or network equipment, but due to its lack of encryption, it poses security risks and has largely
 been replaced by encrypted protocols like SSH.
